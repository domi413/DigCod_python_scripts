# DigCod Python Scripts for TI-Nspire

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed for use with the TI-Nspire calculator.

## Usage

To use these scripts on your TI-Nspire calculator:

1. Connect your Handheld to the computer.
2. Open the TI-Nspire Student Software.
3. Create a new Python script within the software.
4. Copy and paste the content of each `.py` script into the new Python script you created.
5. Use the "File -> Save to Handheld" function to transfer the script to your calculator.

### Alternatively:

1. Open Chrome (it's required to use Chrome for this method).*1
2. Navigate to [TI-Nspire Navigator](https://nspireconnect.ti.com/nsc/).
3. Choose the option to transfer files.

*1 -> This method doesn't work on linux, so there is no option to load the files from a linux desktop. (Maybe with a VM?)

## Running Scripts

To execute a script on the TI-Nspire:

1. Navigate to the script on your handheld.
2. Press `ctrl+r` to run the script.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input numbers and observe the output.
